Submit a pull request that edits the entries in our `_config.yml` to be correct for you. [See my example](https://github.com/inf380p/inf380p.github.io/pull/430/files)

1. Find the `_config.yml` file in Github's Code tab. Click it.
2. Click edit.
3. Make your edits.
4. Describe your changes.
5. Commit to a new branch and follow the four (4) screens you need to click through to end up with an open pull request.

Some notes: Avoid line breaks.  Quote strings if you're worried about special characters. Keep calm and carry on.
