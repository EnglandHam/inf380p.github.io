Create two trinkets that use the turtle module.

# One from the textbook

One should be an answer to your choice of questions 16-20 in the WriteCode section 17.14 of our textbook.

# One of your own design

The other should be a turtle program of your own design that uses:

* for loops
* chained conditionals (i.e. `if` followed by `elif` and/or `else`)
* a function

Beyond these requirements, get creative with what your program looks like!

# Reflection

Write a 2-3 paragraph reflection on the experience of writing your own Turtle program, noting any lightbulbs, confusions, problem solving strategies, or other metacognitive aspects of your coding process. Use code blocks as needed.

This reflection can be composed in any text editor/word processor, but will need to be in Markdown for any formatting to display correctly.

# Submission

Bring these elements to class. We will create a post using them on Github together.
