Your midterm will be due.  Instructions will be on the PDF I distribute, but here are the basics:

* I usually hand out paper copies, but this year you'll need to **print your own**.
* Complete the midterm as directed in the document I give you.
* When done, use an app like [Genius Scan](https://thegrizzlylabs.com/genius-scan/) to make a PDF that is reviewable by others

This midterm is for *formative* learning. That is, it will help you diagnose what you understand and give you motivation to learn things you don't in the moment you realize you don't understand them. Hopefully, it makes you revisit some of our readings and other resources to help you answer questions. It is **open book** for this reason. It may feel like "cheating" to go look up the answer or get help from our resources, but I'm helping you trick your brain into learning these things in the context of an authentic need: getting the answer right on a test.

While it is open book, **do not give or recieve help to/from anyone else**. Doing so would defeat the midterm's purpose and constitute an honor violation.

As a reminder, the midterm counts for **0%** of your grade. Don't stress, but take it seriously because it's a learning tool for you.
