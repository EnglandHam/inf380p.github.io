**Exercise 1:**

Write a function called `chop` that takes a list and returns it with the first and last elements removed.  If the list has only one or two elements, return `None`.  Print several **calls** to your function with various inputs to check your work.


**Exercise 2:**

```python
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    words = line.split()
    # print 'Debug:', words
    if len(words) == 0 :
      continue
    if words[0] != 'From' :
      continue
    print(words[2])
```

This program is designed to extract email addresses from `mbox-short.txt`.  It contains conditionals which are designed to prevent the `words[2]` call from failing.

Figure out which line of the above program is still not properly guarded. See if you can construct a text file which causes the program to fail and then modify the program so that the line is properly guarded and test it to make sure it handles your new text file.

**Exercise 3:**
