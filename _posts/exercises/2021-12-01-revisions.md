Going back over items in this course that puzzled you can be a really powerful way to cement your learning.

You may submit up to 3 trinkets based off of difficult Runestone problems that you didn't get the first time around, along with a reflection on what wasn't clear for you intially and what changed for you. This is intended to encourage you to revisit areas of our course material that weren't as clear to you.

The important components of this are:

* correct/revised code
* a substantial reflection about what you've learned since originally completing the exercise

Once you have completed **all** of the revisions you intend to, email or Canvas message me and Misha with links to the pull requests and/or specific Trinket items you revised so that we can review them. We will *either* revise your prior homework grade, or add a small amount of extra credit to your Exercises grade, whichever benefits you more.
