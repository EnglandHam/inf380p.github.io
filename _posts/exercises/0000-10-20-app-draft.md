Bring your app draft to class for a peer clinic.  There's nothing to turn in so you can focus
on your app, but you should have made some initial progress so that you can take advantage of the clinic.
We'll also have time to work on clinic feedback in class.

Keep your milestones in mind, and *revise* them as you learn from the progress you've made.
