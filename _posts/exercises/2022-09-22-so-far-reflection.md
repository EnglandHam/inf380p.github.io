title: "First reflection: the class so far"
---


Bring to class a reflection on your class experience so far. This should be in a digital format that you can copy and paste from. (Beware writing code in word processing programs!!)

**Note: You'll post this reflection, or a version of it, to the class website. You'll be able to choose a pseudonym, so the post will not be tied to your name unless you want it to be. Many students so, and a few students choose pseudonyms each year. There are benefits to each, and this will not affect your grade. I just need to know how to match you to your Github name.*

Cover anything you think is relevant, but make sure to hit these topics:

* What's a lightbulb that has gone on for you? Give an example.
* Describe some confusion you've experienced.  Did it help you learn?
* What's still fuzzy for you?  What will you do to make sure you can resolve your fuzziness?
* What problem solving strategies have been working for you? Give an example.

Include at least **2** code examples from code you've written for this class.
