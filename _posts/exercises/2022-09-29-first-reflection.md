title: First Focused Reflection
---

Focused reflections are a HUGE part of this class!  They help your learning sink in and help me understand where you are.

A good reflection involves thinking about your learning.  Metacognition is the fancy word for this.  Take some time to note places where you were stumped, where you got it, how you pushed yourself, and any emotions that accompanied these processes.  Your reflections are an important learning tool for you.  Treat them like that!


# Assignment

Submit a well-formatted pull request to our class blog with a reflection on specific experience(s) during the first in-class activites, readings, and exercises that was meaningful, fun, challenging, frustrating, etc. Something that stuck with you.

Include one or more embedded Trinkets to show off your work. _Focus_ your reflection around your examples, and go from there to anything else that's come up from you.

Include one or more code blocks, using markdown, to write about specific pieces of code.

Dig into the things that stuck with you, and the process you went through while coding.
