# Announcements

* Copy and paste is your brain's enemy! (Unless you're moving your code around)
* Get ready for some controlled chaos today.

# Q&A

* Anything come up during our light week?

# Github

You'll make two github posts today. A good portion of your work from here on out will involve Trinket and Github.

## Making an account

Your Github user name and display name can be pseudonymous if you'd like to preserve your anonymity. Many students choose to begin to build a public Github profile in this class, or already have an account they prefer to use.

Github is a set of services and web wrappers around the open source version control system **git**. If you go on to become a software developer, you'll probably use git extensively. In this class, my goal if for you to become familiar with interacting with others on Github, rather than to use version control. To do that, you'll be submitting posts that will show up on our class website.

## Jekyll

Jekyll is the name of the website builder I use for the class website. Let's learn a little bit about that.

## Your first post

Follow the "Github Basics" in-class exercise together. I'll be TommyTester


# Your First Reflection, with Embedded Trinkets

Another in-class exercise. You'll need the Trinkets you included in your reflection so you can embed them.

## Writing about code

With this new tool, you now have the ability to make posts with:

* a working program your reader can run and modify
* formatted code blocks and inline code so your reader can follow along
* deeply integrated reflections

Let's check out Tommy Tester's example post.

# Next week & beyond

You'll see some videos about the `turtle` module, and learn about using `Turtle` objects. 

In two weeks, you'll complete a Clicky TurtleHack! That is:
* a program that responds to user clicks and keypresses
* A reflection, in Markdown, containing the program, some static code blocks, your process, and your reflections on your coding journey for that program specifically.

There's a reading on Markdown, which will help you format your posts. Treat it as a reference.
