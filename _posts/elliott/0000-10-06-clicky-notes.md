# Q & A

* Study session update
* Moving midterm back to Nov 4th
* REMOTE class next week

# Pair Programming Review

*"Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation (one screen, keyboard and mouse among the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the "driver", the other, also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the "navigator"; it is expected that the programmers swap roles every few minutes or so. - See more [here](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/pairing.html)"*

* Communication is key!  Think out loud.  Work your partner into your thought process.
* Pair programming may feel slower.  That's natural.  Slow down and buy in to get the benefits.
* The Navigator can't get anywhere without the driver.
* The Driver doesn't know where to go without the navigator.
* Tell your partner what you need from them.  Ask them for it!

# Part I: Clicky turtlehack

You know the drill.  Pair up, merge up, confirm the file is visible on the site. If not, work together to determine why. Take a break once all partners' work is displaying on the site. Reconvene at the agreed-upon time.

**If you have changes requested on your reflection pull request, address them during a break**

# Clicky Turtle Discussion

First, let's review the [starter code]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/clicky-turtles.html).

Then, in new pairs, play with and discuss each other's work!

# Part II: Pair up & Make a Name For Yourself

Our class website runs off of a config file.  Time to tell us who you are (or want to be known as).

Reminder: your public activities in this class can be pseudonymous if you want them to be. You can, but don't have to, include personal information in your bio, display name, and links.

First: let's have a demo!

It's [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/make-a-name-for-yourself.html)

**If you have changes requested on your reflection pull request, address them during a break**

# Part III: Reflecting

Let's discuss your reflections on the class so far.

# Looking Ahead

We'll make app milestones for your blackjack or drawing app next time!  **Think** about them.  We'll discuss them and put them into a post during class.

Also, read **Chapter 7** and **Chapter 9**. If you like, get started on the **Chapter 7** exercises on Trinket. The next class notes have some good information on lists of lists that will help you.
