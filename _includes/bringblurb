Bring the code you write for the below exercise to the following class. There are many ways you can do this. 

This is the easiest:

* Sign up for a free Trinket account, create a new trinket, and do the work there. Note: you'll want to press Save before sharing a link or getting embed code to ensure that others see the latest version of your code.

If you don't want to create a Trinket account, here are some options:

* Use the Share button to get a link to your work. Note: you'll want to get a new link after making any changes. Bookmark or save the link somewhere convenient.
* Copy and paste the code out of trinket, then paste it into a trinket the day of class.
* Download the trinket code and then copy and paste it into a trinket the day of class.

*There is nothing to turn in*, but you will want to hang on to this code so that you can reference or embed it in future reflections.
