Submit a [well-formatted](/how-to/exercise/githubbasics.html) **pull request** to our class website with **embedded Trinket program(s)** for the assignment below.
Complete this on your own, using any class materials you need (including the additional resources on the syllabus). Do not
look at other students' submissions until after you've completed your work.

Include a **thoughtful reflection**, and use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) as needed to make your writing about your code clear and understandable to others. Your reflection should articulate what you think you've learned and any concepts that are still fuzzy to you. Did you encounter frustrating situations? Did you feel a lightbulb turn on?


In your program, remember to leave comments via Python's `#` or using Trinket's [inline comments](https://docs.trinket.io/getting-started-with-trinket-connect#/in-line-comments/using-comments) as needed to orient your reader.

**After your programs are done**, check other students' work and other resources online if you had questions.
